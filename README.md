# To-Do-List

This a To-Do List App. In this project, I have added a number of functionality to the application to make it interactive. The user will be able to mark task completion by selecting the corresponding checkbox (or undo it by unchecking the checkbox). The updated tasks list will be stored in local storage. See the screenshot below:
